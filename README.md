# Pymunk-Pong
This is an application of pymunk in creating a pong game, showing how physics can be used in graphics.

## Graphics
This simulation is created by getting the place of the objects in their respective pymunk space

## Physics
The physics are enabled by a physics engine pymunk, which automatically do things for us like gravity or kinematic objects
